# Vite + TypeScript + Three.js + React

This repository provides a minimal setup for integrating **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Three.js**. It features a streamlined environment with fast build times, Hot Module Replacement (HMR), and type-safe linting.

## Features

- **Vite** for rapid development and builds
- **React** with **TypeScript** for modern, type-safe development
- **Three.js** for creating 3D graphics
- **ESLint** configuration for type-aware linting

## Technologies Used

- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: A next-generation frontend tool for fast builds and HMR.
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)**: A JavaScript library that makes creating and displaying 3D graphics in the browser easy.
